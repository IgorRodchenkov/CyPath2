<h2>Pathway Commons App</h2>

<p>
This network was created with Pathway Commons app and <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc2/">web service</a>,
which either directly mapped the <a href="http://www.biopax.org">BioPAX</a> result to Cytoscape (network, view, tables),
or <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc2/formats#sif_relations">binary interactions</a> were first inferred
from the BioPAX model (with Paxtools pattern library) and then converted to SIF format, and to Cytoscape.
