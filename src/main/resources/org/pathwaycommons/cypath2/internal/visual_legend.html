Current network was created from BioPAX pathway data reduced to the SIF format with Paxtools java library
using all or some of the <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc2/formats#sif_relations">binary interaction types</a>.
The SIF inference rules, starting from Cytoscape 3.3, have been much re-written and renamed
compared with that in former versions
(<a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc/sif_interaction_rules.do">old binary interaction types</a>).
