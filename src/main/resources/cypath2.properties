<html><body><h2>Pathway Commons CyPath2 v.${project.version}</h2><p>\
This app provides access from within Cytoscape to the \
<a href='http://www.pathwaycommons.org'>Pathway Commons (PC)</a> \
library of biological pathways and interactions. \
BioPAX and PSI-MI formatted data were collected \
from several curated biological pathway data providers. \
The PC team selected, validated, normalized, merged and indexed \
the data and run the <a href='http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc2/'>web services</a>, \
powered by the cPath2 software, to which this app &quot;talks&quot;.</p></body></html>
